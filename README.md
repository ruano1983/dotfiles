# Dotfiles

My dotfiles for multiple window managers, with special attention to **Qtile in wayland** as my favorite window manager. I also include extra applications like Rofi Cava, vifm, ranger ,Vim, Nano, dunst, and shells like Bash and Fish.

I also offer some custom color themes for vim nano rofi, vifm and most importantly qtile with quite simple color schemes.
