# Dotfiles

My dotfiles for multiple window managers, including Sway and RiverWM, with special attention to Qtile (Wayland) as my favorite window manager. I also include extra applications like Rofi Cava, vifm, Vim, Nano, and shells like Bash and Fish.

I also offer some custom color themes for vim nano rofi, vifm and most importantly qtile with quite simple color schemes.
